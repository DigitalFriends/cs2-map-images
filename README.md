# Counter-Strike 2 Map Images
Here are map screenshots that you can use for your CS2 related projects. The goal is to serve as a public high quality ***(but usable)*** repositry that anyone can use for their projects.

## Want to add maps?
1. Strictly images taken from inside of CS2 only.
2. Your image must be in **16:9** ratio and **1920x1080px**.
3. No hud included. **(cl_drawhud 0 or cl_draw_only_deathnotices 1**)
4. Images must be in **`.pn0g`** format.
5. Keep files under **~1mb** in filesize. ***(Compress the images before uploading with https://tinypng.com/ to reach this size)***
6. The image name must be the exact map filename for example **`de_mirage.png`**.
7. All images must be places in the CS2 folder. This way people can link to it and simply change the map name on their url for their project.
8. No logos or urls in the images.

## FAQ
**- Q. Why only 1920x1080?**
	**A.** Images like this are only really ever used in thumbnails or in designs where the image itself is not the focus.

**- Q. Why 1MB?**
	**A.** This is to keep the collection at a manageable file size once there are thousands of images.
